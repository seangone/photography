## Focal length
### What the focal length determines?
**Focal length determines the angle of view postively, which gives the eyes the feeling of depth, aka. perspective.**

It is often introduced in many articles that the focal length gives the the magnification of the view, and as a learner I think it is quite misunderstanding because you could walk closer to the target that you shot to get a bigger magification in the obtained image. Also, the goal of choosing focal length is to serve the needs of how the photo looks like.


Our **feeling of depth** is based on one rule which we encrypt in our genes:

**The farther one object is, the smaller and the sharper it shows in our view. And as the contrary, the closer it is, the bigger and the more blurred it sees.**

So, the more we want to make our photos look deeper, the lens with bigger angle of view we should use. It is clearly judged by the angle between two parellels in reality. 

### How to Choose the right focal length?
Bigger focal length result in lower range of view. It is often devided into several ranges. They are **Ultra Wide Angle 14-24mm**, **Wide Angle 24-35mm**, **Standard 35-70mm**, **Mild Telephoto 70-105mm** and **Telephoto 105-300mm**.

It is shown in the above picture how the focal length decides our feeling of depth and that walking closer or further to the target subjects cannot replace the effect of choosing the lens with the specific focal length.

### Actual Focal Length and 35 mm equivalent focal length.

The above classification of focal length is based on 35 mm equivalent focal length. And we often refered to the lens with actual focal length. To get the 35 mm equivalent focal length, we use a crop factor, which is determined by the camera, to multiply the Actual Focal Length of the lens.

Why the 35mm equivalent focal length is introduced is that different camera have different sensor frame size.
